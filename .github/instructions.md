# YouTube Timestamp Bookmarker Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension project that allows users to bookmark timestamps in YouTube videos. The extension uses:

- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Chrome Storage API for saving bookmarks
- Content Scripts for interacting with YouTube pages
- Chrome Tabs API for communication between popup and content script

When suggesting code changes or improvements:

1. Ensure compatibility with Chrome Extension Manifest V3
2. Follow Chrome Extension best practices for security and performance
3. Maintain clean separation between popup and content script functionality
4. Consider user experience and interface responsiveness
